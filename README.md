# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning
Final project for CSE150A:Intro to AI:Probabilistic Reasoning. 

Here I will build a Deep QNet from scratch which combines deep learning with Q learning. My goal is to fit the QNet to play several games on OpenAI's Gym.

[Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236.pdf) is the classical paper about DQN

Libraries:
TensorFlow 2.1
Numpy
Gym

这玩意好像不收敛.....
