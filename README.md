# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning
Final project for CSE150A:Intro to AI:Probabilistic Reasoning. 

Here I will build a Deep QNet from scratch which combines deep learning with Q learning. My goal is to fit the QNet to play several games on OpenAI's Gym.

[Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236.pdf) is the classical paper about DQN

Libraries:
TensorFlow 2.1
Numpy
Gym

Typical reward curve for deep reinforcement learning: It never converges and is really noisy. However, you can see the demo video of the cartpole after 1000 iterations of my code, which is pretty nutty.
